In order to install the LAMP stack, you need to install apache, mysql and php.
Issue the following commands to install the lamp stack:

alps install apache mysql php

The mysql build script would ask for the root password after installing mysql.
You need to enter the root password when asked for. During the installation of
net-snmp, you would be asked to press enter 3-4 times. Press enter 3-4 times
when asked and net-snmp script would start building. Once that is done, php
would get installed.

Now start the servers:

sudo systemctl enable {mysqld,php-fpm,httpd}
sudo systemctl start {mysqld,php-fpm,httpd}

sudo chmod -R a+rw /srv/www/

The build scripts follow the server directory hierarchy that is used in BLFS.
Hence the document root for apache would be at /srv/www. Let's create a php
file in this location to see if things went fine:

cat > /srv/www/info.php<<EOF
<?php phpinfo();?>
EOF

Now open up the browser and access the following URL:

http://localhost/info.php

You should be able to see the PHP's info page.

To check mysql run the following command from terminal:

mysql -uroot -p<root password>

In the above command replace <root password> with the password you gave to the
mysql build script. This should show you the mysql prompt. You can run quit at
the mysql prompt to exit.

Finally you may set index.php as the default page to be used as directory index.
Run the following sed command to use index.php as the directory index page:

sed -i "s@DirectoryIndex index.html@DirectoryIndex index.html index.php@g"
