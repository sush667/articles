AryaLinux 2016.04 â€“ Release Notes
This version of AryaLinux primarily focusses on creating a stable from-scratch system and eliminating as many small nuances as possible that sum up to a not-so 
happy build experience

    Updated all packages to the latest development of LFS and the current development version of BLFS systemd.
    Upgraded Mate to 1.12.0
    Fixed a lot of broken features with alps like selfupdate, clean and updatescripts
    Eliminated boot time warning messages
    Incorporated dracut to facilitate the creation of initrd. Initrd is more stable now.
    The same set of scripts can be utilized to create both 32 bit and 64 bit systems.
    Scripts now run faster owing to the usage of ccache and MAKEFLAGS
    Added support for UEFI systems. Though as of now the builder/live disks cannot boot from a UEFI BIOS, AryaLinux can be built from within Ubuntu/Mint/Any 
other Linux installed in a UEFI BIOS based system.
    Tested on GPT based Drives and tested successful.
    Added script to create Live Disks from the generated system
    Blueman is back with Blueman Applet and has been tested OK. The blueman shipped with version A15 was buggy.
    Inconsistent build issues were coming up due to toolchain and final system being built on different systems. So had to bring back the whole toolchain 
building proecss. No more binary toolchain.
    ccache script
    Added audacious in favour of banshee. Banshee was too much hard work owing to the vast number of dependencies and primarily dependencies of unmaintained 
packages.
    Replaced brasero with xfburn because brasero was resulting in way too much gnome dependencies.
    Few build scripts like sane and alsa-plugins ask for the username and add it to the corresponding group that they are creating.
    Rewrote new installer.
    Most packages now build on multiple CPUs, including toolchain and base-system.
    Plymouth bootsplash now shows up while booting, thanks to dracut. It makes initramfs creation a breeze.
