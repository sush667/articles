ALPS troubleshooting

This article outlines few issues that may come up while running alps and how to fix them

Broken Download Link
In case alps fails due to a broken download link, then use alps to download the package using some other location by using the alps src command. First of all 
open up the browser and search for the same package name as alps was trying to download. Let’s assume while installing parted, alps tried downloading the 
tarball from the following link:
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/parted/parted-3.2.tar.xz
and it failed. Then search for the package tarball name online. Like in this case the tarball name is parted-3.2.tar.xz. So I search for this and found that it 
can be downloaded from the following alternate link:
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/repo/pkgs/parted/parted-3.2.tar.xz/0247b6a7b314f8edeb618159fa95f9cb/parted-3.2.tar.xz
So the next thing I do is run:

alps src http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/repo/pkgs/parted/parted-3.2.tar.xz/0247b6a7b314f8edeb618159fa95f9cb/parted-3.2.tar.xz

That would download the package tarball to appropriate location. Now I can continue installing by running alps install… again.
Failure in the build scripts
Build scripts might fail due to one of the following reasons:

    Dependencies were not installed before the package was installed
    Some command in the build scripts failed.
    Unknown reasons

In any case we would appreciate if you could start a thread highlighting the failure in our linuxquestions.org forum and we would look into the matter and try 
to reply as soon as possible. Its also possible that someone else might have encountered the same issue and would reply you back. Now, in case some dependency 
was not met and a build failed, you would see that while the script’s configure part would be running. Please note the package which is missing and try to find 
out the build script for the same in the scripts directory: /var/cache/alps/scripts. In case you find a script there, then run alps install <script name without 
.sh> and then retry. In case some command in the build script failed, then please copy as much as log information as you can and post the same in this thread. 
We would surely try assisting you as soon as we can. In other cases, please try seaching online if you find a solution because that is what we would do as well 
and in case something works for you, please let us know. We would fix and re-upload the script.
