Welcome to AryaLinux
###
AryaLinux is a GNU/Linux system built from scratch using instructions from the LFS and BLFS books. The purpose of the LFS and BLFS books are to guide an 
average Linux user to build her own Linux Box using source code of the various packages that a GNU/Linux System is composed of. AryaLinux automates the whole 
process through usage of build scripts and tools that complement the operations that are carried out to build your own Linux from Scratch. We also provide build 
scripts that help in the creation of packages not provided in the LFS/BLFS books.
