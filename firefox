alps install firefox

You can also install the binary version of firefox by running the following command:

alps install firefox-bin

This would download the latest binaries from firefox servers for the language that you choose and install it. Installation is done in the /opt directory so that later you might remove this version of firefox and install some other version. Despite being installed in /opt some files like:

firefox.desktop (/usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop)
firefox.png (/usr/share/pixmaps/firefox.png)

are created in /usr.

Notes:

Firefox does'nt play well with dark themes. This is'nt a new thing for people who've been using firefox on linux for a while but the casual new user might think its strange and quirky.

No loading icon shown on tabs

If you install firefox from source you might not get the loading icon on the tabs that you open.

Fonts issue in firefox:

If firefox renders ugly fonts, you might go ahead and delete fonts in /usr/share/fonts/<-----> directory by doing:

sudo rm -r /usr/share/fonts/<----->

Tabs are not saved on exit:

If you build firefox from source tabs would not be saved on exit. For that you need to install firefox-bin. See the top of the page for instructions to do so.
